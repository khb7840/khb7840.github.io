Folddisco is a novel inverted-index method that overcomes earlier methodsâ€™ limitations and, for the first time, can detect structural motifs throughout entire protein databases. It also reduces the index size so that the full AlphaFoldDB can fit on a single disk, enabling large-scale motif searches on a single machine. Key innovations include a reduction in index storage by omitting location information, improved precision through a new side-chain orientation encoding feature, and significantly faster searching via an optimized index structure.
