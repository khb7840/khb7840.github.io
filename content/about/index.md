My name is Hyunbin Kim. I am a bioinformatician and genomic researcher. 
<!-- I am currently working at the [Genomic Medicine Institute](https://www.gmi.ac.kr) in Seoul, South Korea. 
I am interested in developing bioinformatics tools and algorithms for analyzing genomic data. I am also interested in studying the genetic basis of human diseases using genomic data. -->

Somewhere between bioinformatician and genomic researcher. Daydreaming coffee addict.
